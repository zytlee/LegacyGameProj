### Description

JsonAsAsset is an [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) plugin that reads [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) files from FModel [(UEParse)](https://github.com/FabianFG/CUE4Parse), and rebuilds assets like materials, data tables, physics assets, and more.

✨ [Contributors](#contribute)

### Example Use

* Importing **materials**, data assets, and data tables — [see more](#asset-types)
* Porting **physics assets** for skeletal meshes
* Porting **sound effects** to Unreal Engine
* Automating asset porting workflows

This project aims to streamline the porting and modding experience, making it easier to bring game assets into Unreal Engine.

#### The following asset types add onto a pre-existing asset
|  | Asset Types |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **🔴 Animation** | AnimSequence, AnimMontage **(Animation Curves)** |

<a name="material-data-prerequisites"></a>
#### 🟠 Material Data Prerequisites
Unreal Engine games made below 4.12 (a guess) will have material data. *Games made above that version will most definitely not have any material data*, and therefore the actual data will be stripped and cannot be imported. **Unless you are using a User Generated Content editor**, then it's possible material data will be there.

#### 🟣 C++ Classes Prerequisites
If your game uses custom C++ classes or structures, **you need to define them**.

See [Unreal Engine Modding Projects](https://github.com/Buckminsterfullerene02/UE-Modding-Tools?tab=readme-ov-file#game-specific-template-projects) for game-specific template projects.

## Installation
[<img align="left" width="150" height="150" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8e4f9c9-1268-4aee-ab1a-dabee31b3069?raw=true">](https://fmodel.app)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you haven't already, **install [FModel](https://fmodel.app) and set it up correctly, then proceed with the setup**.
>
>
> ​There is a specific FModel version for **material data support** found in the discord server.            
> [**Material Data Prerequisites still apply.**](#material-data-prerequisites)

We strongly recommend using the latest **commit** of JsonAsAsset to ensure compatibility with recent Unreal updates and access to the newest features.

Follow these steps to install **JsonAsAsset**:

1. **Visit the Releases Page:**  
   Go to the [Releases page](/../../releases) for the plugin.
3. **Download the Appropriate Release:**    
   Download the release that matches your version of Unreal Engine.  
   If a matching release isn't available, [**compile the plugin yourself**](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/qz93/unreal-engine-building-plugins).
5. **Extract the Files:**  
   Extract the downloaded files to your project's `Plugins` folder. If the folder doesn't exist, create it in the root directory of your project.
7. **Open Your Project**  
   Launch your Unreal Engine project.

<a name="cloud"></a>
### Set up the Cloud ✨
Make sure Cloud is enabled in Plugin Settings, and set up a Cloud Server. [Click here to get to Cloud releases.](https://github.com/Tectors/Core/releases)

Once the Cloud is started, JsonAsAsset will fetch almost every referenced asset for you hands-free.

<a name="workflow"></a>
## Workflow

1. Find an asset in [FModel](https://fmodel.app), and save it by right-clicking and pressing `Save Properties`. Locate the file on your computer and copy the location.

2. Press the [JsonAsAsset](https://github.com/JsonAsAsset/JsonAsAsset) button on your tool-bar, and a file import should pop up. <img align="right" width="206" height="96" src=https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a9bf925-484b-4c23-b0ed-c59d58c5d07c>

3. Select the file and press Open.

4. The asset will import, and bring you to the created asset in the content browser.

### Common Errors 🐛
<details>
  <summary>Assertion failed: TextureReferenceIndex != INDEX_NONE</summary>

------------
  
This is a known issue in our code that we haven't fully resolved yet. While previous attempts to fix it have been unsuccessful, here's a partial solution to reduce its occurrence:

- Re-launch your Unreal Engine project, go to JsonAsAsset's plugin settings and enable ***"Disconnect Root"***. Also enable ***"Save Assets"***.
